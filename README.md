# IHNVcode
Code for sequences/evolutionary analysis of U genogroup IHNV

This repo holds code that I used to do sequence and evolutionary analysis on U genogroup IHN virus as part of my Master's research.
The code was used for a variety of purposes, including:
a) pulling info in excel files into text files
b) sequence comparison against a reference sequence
c) making figures (both in Python and in R)

I have also included some key output files, so that they can be used by other members of the Kurath lab, or just to provide
an example of the code output.
