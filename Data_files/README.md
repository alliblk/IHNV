### This repo contains FASTA format input files used in the maximum likelihood, coalescent, and phylogeographic analyses presented in "Geography and host species shape the evolutionary dynamics of U genogroup infectious hematopoietic necrosis virus‚Äù. 

* 114UniqueSeqs.txt

This file has 114 genotypes representing all unique genotypes that were detected in the study. It is the input file for the maximum likelihood analysis

* AllU/UC/UP_Events

These files contain FASTA formatted records for all 619 U events, only UC events, or only UP events.
These files were used in the coalescent phylogenetic and phylogeographic analysis.

* AllU/UC/UP...SubSamp


These files are the fasta formatted files that were created by equitably subsampling the full events dataset.
They were used for the secondary phylogeographic analyses.
